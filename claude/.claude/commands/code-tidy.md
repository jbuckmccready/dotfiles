description: Tidy up code by running linter and formatter
---

**IMPORTANT:** Use any relevant language specific skills available to determine the appropriate linter and formatter commands.

1. Run linter
2. Fix any warnings
3. Run linter again to confirm fixed (repeat as necessary)
4. Run formmatter

**IMPORTANT:** if there are no changes made to fix linter warnings then do not run any tests.

After formatting only respond with "Code tidied."
