**IMPORTANT:** Use any relevant language specific skills available to determine the appropriate linter and formatter commands.

1. Run type check (if applicable to the language)
2. Fix any issues
3. Run type check again to confirm fixed (repeat as necessary)
4. Run linter
5. Fix any issues
6. Run linter again to confirm fixed (repeat as necessary)
7. Run formatter

**IMPORTANT:** if there are no changes made to fix issues then do not run any tests.

After formatting only respond with "Code tidied."
