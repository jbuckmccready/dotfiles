Help me brainstorm ideas for a concept or goal I have in mind. The goal may be abstract or specific to the current project. I am only trying to get ideas, avoid implementation details unless critical to understanding the idea. Look at the existing project only if relevant to the input given, but don't feel limited by it, and push back with suggestions for breaking with existing approaches or plans if warranted.

Come up with multiple ideas, for each idea provide a high level description for how it would work, the positives and negatives of the approach, and any unknowns that need further analysis or research.

For each idea, use this format:

```md
### Idea: <one-line summary>

<Description of the idea and how it would work>

**Positives:**
<List of the advantages or benefits of this idea>

**Negatives:**
<List of the disadvantages or potential issues with this idea>

**Unknowns:**
<List of any questions or areas that require further research to evaluate this idea>
```
