This plan looks good, proceed:

- Write this plan out to a markdown file in `./pi/todos/`, name it `{date}-{slug-description}.md` (e.g. `2024-06-01-refactor-connection.md`)
- Create TODOs for all the work to be done:
  - Divide work across TODOs that make sense for the work to be done
  - Incude in each TODO body any dependency on other TODOs
  - Each TODO's body includes a reference to the plan file for context
  - The TODO body should clearly state the work to be done - it should be actionable and specific, include acceptance criteria if possible
  - For anything that requires further research make a TODO for the research work, and then make the TODOs for the work that depends on that research depend on the research TODO
- After creating the TODOs update the plan file with the list of TODOs created and their dependencies on other TODOs
